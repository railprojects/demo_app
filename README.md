# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Demo application
This is the first application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

The demo app will consist of users and their associated microposts (thus constituting a minimalist Twitter-style app).
